## DESCRIPTION

Behavioral scientist have called for further research in how different 
cultures around the world communicate abstract domains. As of now 
research has been limited  to isolated studies that compare only one 
aspect of abstract thought and language. In terms of a solution we 
propose to develop an integrated, extensible, public,open-access 
databank called (ATLAS) Databank on how humans think and communicate 
about abstract domains like space, time, and number. The end goal is to 
allow cognitive scientist, linguists, or anthropologists to develop new 
questions and analyze regularities within multiple linguistic
communities along with their conceptual doamins.
